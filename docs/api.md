The CarML webserver exposes REST API endpoints.
These are the same endpoints used by the javascript client to interact with the system.
This section describes the different REST API endpoints along with their purpose.

!> An OpenAPI specification is avaible and can be used in conjunction with tools such [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to create requests. The Swagger UI (shown on the left) can also be used to make REST requests.
